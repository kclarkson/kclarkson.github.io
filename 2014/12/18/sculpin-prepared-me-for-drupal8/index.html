<p>Earlier last year I realized I had found my drupal calling with front-end development. with a little help from a fellow canadian he suggested I apply for a front-end developer job at a great Drupal Company. It was then that I finallly realized I was a front-end developer. I have always been the DIY guy to put a website. I will spend countless hours trying to figure out how to make the site look like that.</p>
