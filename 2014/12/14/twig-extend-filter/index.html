<p>When looking through the Twig Documentation by the awesome folks at Sensio Labs you can often get lost in the robust set of features  that come baked into twig.</p>

<p>One of the awesome features in Twig is the ability to use the extends feature for templating. Verys similar to how you can use @extend in SASS to reuse code the extend feature is great.</p>

<p>This is common when you want to re-use code from for the <head> tag.  Butwhat if you want to use some of the header code but want to cusomize some of it.</p>

<p>Simple solution is give them blocks the print with a space empty.</p>
