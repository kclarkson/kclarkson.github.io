<p>While retraining the brain to go old school with markdown and raw HTML. One thing I was looking for was the date posting. Come to find out Sculpin can read the URL of your post if written in a certain syntaxt.  In combination with the naming you can now use twig <code>date</code> filter you can unlock a ton of goodness.</p>

<pre><code>namespace Foo;

/**
 * Awesome Contrived Example.
 */
class Bar implements BarInterface
{
    private $baz;

    public function __construct(BazInterface $baz)
    {
        $this-&gt;baz = $baz;
    }

    public function doIt()
    {
        return $this-&gt;baz-&gt;do('it');
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>You can also use <a href="http://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/extra/#fenced-code-blocks">fenced code blocks</a> with a syntax declaration at the top.
The markers are <code>~</code> instead of <code>`</code>.</p>

<pre><code class="php">if ($fencedCodeBlock-&gt;syntax !== 'PHP') {
    throw new UnexpectedValueException("wat");
}
</code></pre>

<p>Like this addition to the skeleton? You can thank for <a href="https://github.com/Pawka">@Pawka</a>
for suggesting it. :)</p>
